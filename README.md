Cross-Border Payment Intelligence Platform (MVP)

Overview

This project is an early-stage fintech prototype focused on improving cross-border money transfers between Africa and abroad, starting with a single pilot corridor.



The platform does not replace existing remittance providers. Instead, it acts as an intelligent coordination layer that selects the best available transfer option for each transaction based on cost, speed, reliability, and local settlement availability.



Problem

Sending money to and from Sub-Saharan Africa is expensive, unreliable, and confusing.



Key issues:



High transfer fees (often above 8%)

Multiple intermediaries and delays

Poor integration between mobile money and global payment systems

Hidden FX costs and lack of transparency

Failed transfers with unclear explanations

High reliance on cash handling

Solution

This platform introduces an intelligent routing and local settlement approach:



Users interact with a single simple interface

The system evaluates multiple providers behind the scenes

Transfers are routed using local settlement where possible

Money is moved locally on both ends instead of crossing borders per transaction

Fees, FX rates, and delivery time are shown upfront

Transactions are tracked with clear status updates

The platform does not hold user funds and operates in partnership with licensed providers.
